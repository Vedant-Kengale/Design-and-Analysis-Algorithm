*1. Customer Order Sorting System*
*Objective:* Design and implement a sorting algorithm using Merge Sort to efficiently arrange customer orders based on their timestamps.

*Problem Statement:*
Develop a solution that handles large datasets (up to 1 million orders) with minimal 
computational overhead. The implementation should efficiently sort customer orders by their timestamps using the Merge Sort algorithm.

*Requirements:*
 - Implement Merge Sort algorithm for timestamp-based sorting
 - Handle datasets with up to 1 million orders
 - Minimize computational overhead
 - Analyze time complexity
 - Compare performance with traditional sorting techniques

*Expected Analysis:*
 - Time complexity analysis of Merge Sort
 - Comparison with other sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
 - Performance evaluation on large datasets
